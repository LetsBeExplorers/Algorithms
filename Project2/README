CS5720 Project1 Fall2024: Hybrid Sorting
To generate my CS 5720 Project 2, complete the following steps:

1. Download all the files into the same directory
2. Make the project2.sh file executable
	chmod 777 project2.sh
3. Run project1.sh
	./project1.sh

This assumes you have a Python 3.x environment with numpy and matplotlib, and that you have LaTeX on your system with the required libraries.
